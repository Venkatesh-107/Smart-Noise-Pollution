# 📍 Noise Pollution Mapping – SmartNoise

🌐 **Live Prototype**: [smart-noise-c5b8d.web.app](https://smart-noise-c5b8d.web.app/)

SmartNoise is an environmental awareness platform that maps **real-time and historical noise pollution** using geolocation. Think of it as Google Maps, but for sound—designed to support public health initiatives and sustainable city planning.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

SmartNoise allows users to:
- 🔊 Upload and share decibel readings from various locations.
- 🗺️ Visualize noise levels as color-coded markers on an interactive map.
- 📊 View average noise levels by region.
- 📥 Contribute to a growing, crowdsourced environmental dataset.

Developed as part of an **MSME Innovation Challenge** under the **Low-Carbon Footprint Technologies** theme, addressing challenges in **smart services, public health, and environmental awareness**.

## 🌟 Features

- 📌 **Noise-level Map with Live Markers**
- 📲 **Mobile-responsive UI**
- 🌍 **Geolocation Integration**
- 🔄 **Live + Historical Data Tracking**
- ✅ **Firebase Hosting & Firestore Database**
- 💡 **Tech Stack:**
  - React.js
  - Firebase (Hosting + Firestore)
  - Leaflet.js

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. 📍 User submits location and decibel value.
2. 📡 Data is saved to Firestore.
3. 🗺️ Map updates live with visual markers.
4. 📈 Users explore area-wise noise levels.

## 🚀 Firebase Deployment (for collaborators)

```bash
# One-time setup
1. Replace 'your-project-id' in `.firebaserc` with your Firebase project ID.

# In terminal:
firebase login
firebase init  # (if not already initialized)
firebase deploy
````

This deploys the latest version to Firebase Hosting.

### ✅ Final Tips
- Add this as `README.md` in the root of your GitHub project.
- Add screenshots inside `/public/assets/` or via image links.
- Update `your-project-id` with the actual Firebase project ID.
- You may want to add GitHub tags and topics for discoverability.
